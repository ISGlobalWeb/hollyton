<p>It is no secret that London has produced spectacular returns on investment property in recent years. With the mentality of  Londoners increasingly happy to rent their property, and with the City's population continuing to grow, demand continues to rise.</p>

<p>The challenge, as the market matures, is to source the right investment opportunities. Some areas may already have reached their peak; others still have a way to go. Some types of property present better potential returns than others.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the City's geography, its range of opportunities and changes to its infrastructure that may effect prices and rental yields.
